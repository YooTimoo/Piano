# Piano
Cat Piano is an app where everyone can play the world's most famous musical instrument - piano! Use the keys to create music, and enjoy music anywhere through your computer.

The [pygame] library and some Python code were used. My application is quite simple, but nevertheless very interesting. Even though my code doesn't have even 100 lines, I tried to reduce the code as much as possible so that those who use my app would like to improve it in the future and take my source code as the basis. And then, it is much easier to understand light and laconic code. So I tried to make the code as short as possible, as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said: 
"In character, in manners, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity."

In the future, it is planned to add an opportunity to increase the duration of the piano sound, as well as to improve the graphic background. 
Also will add guitar sounds, bass and drums, beats and rhythms to create a full application for music tracks.

Cat Piano uses language library capabilities, combined with the benefits of object-oriented programming, because in the same code we used note connection and graphical changes when pressing keys. The objects in my code are sound and graphics that perfectly match each other. 

As a result, created applications that develop creativity and love with music in users.


First, install a library:
